# MoneyLens Backend

Express.js backend with TypeScript and MongoDB.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up MongoDB connection:

   - Make sure MongoDB is running locally on default port (27017), or set `MONGO_URI` environment variable.

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # for development with watch mode
   npm start    # for production
   ```

The server will start on port 3000 by default, or set `PORT` environment variable.
